# ABM – Agent-Based Modelling

### Neighborhood Initialization

* How should the neighborhood be initialized at the beginning of the simulation?

* Residents are randomly distributed across neighborhoods.

* Neighborhoods may expand over time based on population density and the income levels of their residents.

### Agent Decision-Making

* Each person evaluates whether the average income level of their current neighborhood exceeds what they can afford.

* If the neighborhood is too expensive, they decide to relocate.

* The person moves to a more affordable neighborhood that better matches their income level.

### Cost–Benefit Analysis
* Before relocating, individuals perform a cost–benefit analysis to determine whether moving is worthwhile.

* Costs may include moving expenses, commuting costs, housing costs, and social disruption.

* Benefits may include improved living conditions, access to amenities, shorter commute times, and greater economic opportunities.

* An individual relocates only if the expected benefits outweigh the associated costs.

### Rational Decision-Making

* Assume each agent behaves rationally and seeks to maximize its utility.

*An agent's utility function could include:

$U_i = \text{Neighborhood Quality} + \text{Amenities} - \text{Housing Cost} - \text{Commuting Cost} - \text{Moving Cost}$

* Each individual chooses the neighborhood that maximizes their utility subject to affordability constraints.

* If the cost of living exceeds an agent's income threshold, the utility of remaining decreases.

* The agent evaluates alternative neighborhoods and moves to the one with the highest utility.

### Nash Equilibrium

* A Nash equilibrium occurs when no agent can improve their utility by unilaterally changing neighborhoods, given the choices of all other agents.

* Agents move between neighborhoods based on their preferences and constraints.

* Moving changes neighborhood composition, which affects housing costs and attractiveness.

* Eventually, the system may reach a stable state where no agent wants to relocate.

That stable configuration can be interpreted as a Nash equilibrium.

* The equilibrium may not be socially optimal.
* Multiple equilibria may exist.
* The system may never converge if the environment changes continuously.

### Model Converge
In order to determine when the model converges, we need some metrics that measure the (macro) neighbourhoods' stability.
* EXAMPLE: for each neighbourhood, measure average income level. Define model stability as the average neighborhood income of all neighbourhoods to not have changed more than some threshold $\epsilon$ for some number of $n$ iterations, i.e
    * $\max_{T-n < t \leq T} \;\max_{k} \left|\mu_t(k) - \mu_{t-1}(k)\right| < \epsilon$
